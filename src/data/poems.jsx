    title: 'Stars around my Scars',
    content:
      `In a garden of beautiful flowers,
I'll still be that dead one even if it showers.
But it's you who brings me happiness and glee,
It's you who injects life into me.

I don't know if it's for ur body or soul,
All I know is my love for you makes me whole.
I am like the moon in search of the stars,
But it's you who drew those stars around my scars.

If I have to make a wish that comes true,
In this cruel world, I'd ask for you,
And also I'd wish for your warm hug,
As if it is an everlasting drug.`,

    title: 'Her Insecure Smile',
    content:
      `It's the beginning of monsoon,
Time for the first shower in June.
The scent of the soil joins the race,
With the flowers' perfume at full pace.

Standing by the cover and peeking,
I heard that silent stare speaking.
It's been a few days and I don't know why,
I'm being chased by the corner of her eye.

But today it's me who's gazing back,
Amazed by her pretty moves to the rain's track.
Meanwhile, our eyes got locked,
Through which a billion stories were talked.

We began having long conversations,
Sharing our deepest secrets and emotions.
We share a few interests between us two,
One of which is watching the skies in blue.

To make her feel less insecure in my own way,
I reveal one naked truth each day.
In a long while, I've seen a smile so innocent and pure,
With the power to heal and cure anything for sure.`,

    title: 'Black and Red',
    content:
      `On the night of our anniversary,
Me in a black suit, and you in a red saree.
We go onto the rooftop,
Under a billion stars atop.
Catch a glimpse of the crescent moon,
Holding hands and kissing soon.
Soothing music playing in the background,
The terrace is the dance floor we found.
A beam of spotlight is all we lack,
And I place my hands on the small of your back.
Your hands around my slender neck, 
With the corners of your eyes on mine, heck!
Gentle footwork back and forth,
I notice my heartbeat's intense growth.
A sudden hit of a cool breeze,
Makes you fall into my arms with ease.
Wrapped within my world's embrace,
The familiar intimate warmth puts my heart in place.
Reminding me of our first hug so magical,
And I realise life comes around in ways so mystical.
I'll cherish your journey from Miss to Mrs,
My love for you is undying, my princess.`,

    title: 'I LOVE YOU',
    content:
      `Is it just attraction, or is it 
Love - eternal, like RadhaKrishn,
Or is it my life, that I'm 
Vowing to devote entirely to you - to
Embrace every second with
You and the bliss of watching you,
Obsessed with counting the stars beside me,
Under the dark night - under the moonlight.`,

    title: `Dancin' in the dark, with you between my arms`,
    content:
      `Last night, I saw you in my dreams,
We walked together under the golden beams.
The moon adored us with a soothing smile,
Watching over from a million mile.
The twinkling stars warded off the evil eye,
Billions in number across the sky.

Holding hands through the silent street,
An act so sweet, my heart's true treat.
Your eyes shone more than ever,
Admiring your beauty is my constant endeavour.
And then the clouds poured a sudden shower,
A dreamy weather at the perfect hour.

We walked back home and up to the terrace,
I felt like standing atop the tower of Paris.
"Dancin' in the dark, with you between my arms",
The melody played, igniting romantic charms.
On my cheek, you planted a gentle kiss,
Filled my heart with butterflies and bliss.`,

    title: 'Art of Deception',
    content:
      `Don't leave me in this grief, 
We are inseparable, I believe.

The dreams in your vision,
Are nothing more than mere illusion. 

I'm here, only if you are near,
You are my sole strength, my dear.

Doesn't matter the place I'm in,
Concurring with you is always a sin.

I can face all the struggles that arise,
With you beside me, I shall rise.


Standing by you has given me pain,
My efforts didn't matter and went in vain

I'll preserve you in my eyes,
Even after the world dies.

I wish I would disappear,
Living life with you is a fear.

I'll love you with all my heart,
Please don't shatter and tear me apart.

Love of the heart is an art of deception,
That might arrange my death reception.`,
